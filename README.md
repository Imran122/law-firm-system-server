## Project Overview:
I am trying to build a law firm system application where there will be 4 roles like Super admin,
admin, agent and member. Here super-admin can control everything in the application.Super admin can accept books or reject centent,make paid or free,create edit or delete package or send custom packages to user.Admin has
some few features to control users and data.An agent is like a university or a law firm who can buy
packages and under the agent all the student or people who will open account can read book or
article. A member is like a single user who can read book by buying a package from the application,contribute content,edit,delte etc. Every role can contribuite content but it will not show untli the super admin accpet.</br></br>
